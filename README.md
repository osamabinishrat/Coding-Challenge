# Mazrui-International-Coding-Challenge
As part of your interviewing process to join the Mazrui International Development Team, you are given the below coding challenge. The purpose of this challenge is not to asses only your coding capabilities, but also your coding style, clearness and documentation as well as your code versioning skills (using git). The functionality is not the primary focus, so donâ€™t waste time on getting the code 100% clean of bugs, that said, the code should run.
